# Job Categories Implementation

This update adds job categories functionality to the job listing system. Categories allow job seekers to better filter jobs and understand what type of positions they're looking at.

## Changes Made

1. **Database Schema Update**: 
   - Added a `categories` TEXT field to the `jobs` table
   - Created SQL update script in `db/update_jobs_add_categories.sql`
   - Created PHP update script in `db/update_jobs_categories.php`

2. **Job Creation API Update**: 
   - Modified `api/jobs/create.php` to accept and save category data
   - Changed the form field from `category` to `category_string` for consistency

3. **Job Display Updates**:
   - Added category badges to job detail view
   - Added category badges to job listing cards (showing first 3 categories)

## How to Implement

### 1. Update Database Schema

Run the PHP update script by visiting:
```
http://your-site.com/db/update_jobs_categories.php
```
Note: You must be logged in as an admin to run this script.

Alternatively, you can run the SQL directly:
```sql
ALTER TABLE jobs ADD COLUMN categories TEXT AFTER job_type;
UPDATE jobs SET categories = '' WHERE categories IS NULL;
```

### 2. Test the Implementation

1. Create a new job listing with categories
2. Verify categories are displayed on the job details page
3. Verify categories are displayed on the job cards in the listing page

### Known Limitations

- Job categories are stored as text, not as relationships in a separate table
- Editing jobs may require updating the existing edit job functionality
- Job search by category may need additional implementation

## Future Improvements

1. Create a proper category system with categories and subcategories tables
2. Add job search and filtering by category
3. Add category statistics (most popular categories, etc.)
