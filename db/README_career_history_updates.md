# Career History and User Profile Updates

## Overview

These updates enhance the GoWork platform by allowing administrators to edit user skills, education, and career history directly from the admin dashboard. 

## Changes Made

1. **Database Schema Standardization**
   - Created `update_career_history.sql` to standardize the career_history table by ensuring the primary key is consistently named `career_id` instead of `id` (which was used in some systems)
   - Added foreign key constraints to ensure referential integrity

2. **Admin Interface Updates**
   - Modified `edit_user.php` to allow administrators to edit skills and education for all user types, not just job seekers
   - Career history editing remains available only for job seeker users as it's role-specific

3. **API Improvements**
   - Enhanced `getEnhancedUserCareerHistory()` function to properly handle both `id` and `career_id` column names for backward compatibility
   - Updated API endpoints to work with the standardized schema
   - Added proper ordering of career history by start date

## How to Test

1. **Database Schema Update**
   - Run the `update_career_history.sql` script to update your database schema
   - Verify with `test_career_history_schema.sql` to confirm changes

2. **Admin Functionality**
   - Log in as an administrator
   - Navigate to the users section and select a user to edit
   - Verify you can edit skills and education for any user type
   - For job seekers, verify you can also edit their career history

## Notes

- Skills and education are now available for all user types in the admin interface
- Career history management is still restricted to job seeker user accounts
- All existing API endpoints should continue to function with the standardized database schema
